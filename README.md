Hello! I am Shovon Rahman, a theoretical physics graduate of the University of Dhaka and a passionate teacher and researcher, currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities. I'm interested in high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nonlinear dynamics. My work focuses on uncertainty quantification in Lattice QCD and jet tagging using graph neural networks. I am driven by curiosity and an ever-deepening desire to explore the mathematical beauty underlying the laws of the universe through theoretical modeling and data analysis. I also take an interest in the philosophical implications of fundamental natural laws.

## **Career Goals**
My long-term goal is to pursue further research in high-energy physics to fortify my knowledge and research skills, which are valuable to the ongoing efforts in answering some of the crucial questions about nature at the fundamental level. I'm deeply passionate about teaching because it lets me interact with students from diverse backgrounds and acquire newer and broader ways of looking at problems. I aspire to work within national research facilities or academic institutions to contribute more to teaching and research.

## **Professional Background**
- **Lecturer in Physics** - Dhaka City College <br>
As part of my teaching duties, I teach electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, the basics of statistical mechanics and atomic models, and nuclear physics to college students. Teaching has significantly deepened my understanding of core physics concepts and enhanced my ability to communicate complex ideas concisely. It has also amplified my eagerness, patience, flexibility, and punctuality.

## **Research Projects**
- **Jet tagging using ML algorithms:**<br>
Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons which are used as a probe to determine the properties of quark gluon plasma, otherwise known as QGP, produced in high energy colliders like the LHC at CERN and RHIC at Brookhaven Laboratory. A challenging task is jet tagging (to classify the particles that initiate jets). SUbtracting the background noise from the signal data requires ML algorithms.
- **Uncertainty quantification in Lattice QCD using resampling techniques:**<br>
Recent theoretical and algorithmic developments along with the advent of high-performance computers have pushed lattice QCD to the precision era, where it becomes essential to assess the statistical uncertainty and sensitivity associated with various measurement techniques and the nature of simulated data and evaluate their reliability.
